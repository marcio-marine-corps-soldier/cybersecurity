### Public Security • National Security • International Security • Cyber Defense • Intelligence  • Counter-Intelligence  • Irregular Warfare

This repository consolidates research, frameworks, models, and tools covering the full spectrum of security operations — from public safety to national defense, from intelligence analysis to cyber warfare.

It serves as a multidisciplinary base connecting digital, physical, institutional, and strategic security domains.
